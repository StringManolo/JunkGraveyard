String Manolo Device Fingerprint Plus Handmade Cipher

At the moment just reading HTTP headers. 
Will add in the future:

-More PHP fingerprint.

-CSS, HTML and javascript device fingerprint.


Cipher design is pretty strong but the implementation at the php file by itself is not.
To be a secure cipher needs at least:

-Reorder each caracter of plaintext. (Will be based on password).

-Make sure the password has the same or more size than the plaintext.

-Use only one password for each ciphertext generated.

-Fix size of Ciphertext.

-ADD extra crypto-secure pseudorandom data based on password each time to avoid chosed plaintext atacks.
